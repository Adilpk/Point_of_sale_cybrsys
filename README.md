I am going to make some changes in the Odoo POS module:

1) Add a new field in the product model, which is "brand", to indicate the brand name of the product. This brand name will be shown in the POS order line and receipts.

2) Add a new feature to set discount limits based on product categories in POS. An error message will pop up when any category limit is exceeded during the purchase of a product through the POS.
